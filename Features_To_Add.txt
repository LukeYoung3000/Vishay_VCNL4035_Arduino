1. Make a "fast" setPsTrigger() function.

	This can be done by saving the changes made in PS_CONF3 register every time
	a variable other then PS_TRIG is changed. Then when setting PS_TRIG it won't
	be necessary to read in the current register value as we will already know
	it (because were tracking the changes). So we can just write the tracked
	value back into PS_CONF3 with the PS_TRIG bit set high.
	NOTE: This method WILL NOT work if there are multiple masters that
	communicate with the VCNL4035.
